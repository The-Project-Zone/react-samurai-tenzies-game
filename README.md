### About
Built with ReactJS/Create React App, this is a portfolio application built to understand the basics of state management. Inspired by the Tenzies Game from the YouTube tutorial for React by Scrimba.com/Free Code Camp. This application was built using Create React App and is hosted on Netlify. It also uses Redux/React Redux for state management as well as the Redux Dev Tools extension to track changes in application state.
